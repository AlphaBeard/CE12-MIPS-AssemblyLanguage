Lab 5: Subroutines 
CMPE 012 Fall 2018

------------------------- 

Q: What was your design approach

A: To be frank, with this lab, I jumped straight into the programming. I did do some practice work with jumping 
and linking with subroutines which included practice using the stack, prior to do the programming. The practive
 obviously helped immensely with the programming.



Q: What did you learn in this lab?

A: I learned the immense importance in reusing subroutines vs. copying and pasting subroutines in a line by line
sort of style to programming. Learning subroutine recursion required me to learn about using the stack to store
variables, using the jump and link commands, and a deeper understanding of the program counter register, and 
return address registers, $pc and $ra respectively.


Q: Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?

A: This lab flowed preetly seemlessly for me, the one issue I encountered was determining what variables I should
push to the stack and which one's weren't necessary. I found later that pushing the arguments to the stack was v
very important if I had a nested subroutine, because the arguments were bound to change. 




Q: How would you redesign this lab to make it better?

A: In the lab sections there were quite a few people I talked to that hadn't been using the stack at all in their
programs. I would spend more emphasis in the lab pdf on the importance of using it.

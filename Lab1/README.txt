-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to use MML and SOP/POS boolean algebra. SOP vastly simplifies the task of creating logic gates. 

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Discovering how to use the program myself was actually pretty effective in teaching me. Initially though, it took me at least 20 minutes to figure how to attach a sender to a reciever.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I'm supportive of us fiddeling with the program before guidance but I do think that showing students a few key features like connecting a sender and receiver should be explained, as well as SOP.

Q: What were the learning objectives of this lab? Write the answer here. 
A: The objectives in this lab were to store data, manipulate data and display data. These three tasks required learning how to use a mux, register, adder, and comparitor in connection to accomplish the task.
 
Q: Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable? Write the answer here. 
A: Of course I encountered many issues along the way and got a good glimpse into what it might be like working on a greater project and the positive habits I should be forming. An effective use of time included a lot of planning on paper and big picture thinking versus just fidgeting with the individual components. Problems I couldn't seem to fix for days were easily reversed by spelling it out on paper. I.E. displaying my score, I had the problem that the score would display the sum of the adder before clicking update, so the score never started at 0. I came up with complicated fixes like starting at -1 which often would start my score at 0, but not always. Eventually with some larger scope I realized that I was displaying the number going into my register, not the number stored into my register. I found those lightbulb moments to be extremely enjoyable and a good payoff.

Q: How would you redesign this lab to make it better? Write the answer here. 
A: Perfect lab in my opinion :)
